# Cookie and Session Reuse

## Definition

A technique where anti-bot clearance cookies obtained through one browser session are extracted and reused across multiple subsequent requests made by a browserless HTTP client. The browser absorbs the cost of the challenge once; the HTTP client amortizes that cost across many requests.

## How It Works

HTTP is stateless. Cookies are the primary mechanism through which servers maintain session continuity across requests. Anti-bot systems issue their own cookies after a client passes their challenge — these cookies are the proof-of-clearance that subsequent requests must present.

The cookie factory pattern formalizes this: a browser (real or headless) navigates a target site, resolves any anti-bot challenges, and accumulates the resulting cookies. Those cookies are then exported and injected into an HTTP client session, which uses them for all subsequent data requests without repeating the challenge.

The economics of this pattern depend heavily on how long the clearance cookies remain valid. A cookie that lasts six months can be used across millions of requests before it needs to be refreshed, making the per-request cost of obtaining it negligible. A cookie that expires in minutes requires frequent re-acquisition, which limits how much the cost can be amortized.

Cookie lifetimes vary significantly by vendor. [Akamai](../entities/akamai.md)'s `_abck` cookie has been observed with a six-month expiry. [Cloudflare](../entities/cloudflare.md)'s `cf_clearance` varies by site configuration. [PerimeterX](../entities/perimeterx.md)'s `_px3` and [DataDome](../entities/datadome.md)'s session cookies behave differently depending on the specific site deployment.

## Where It Matters

Session reuse is most valuable when clearance acquisition is expensive (requires a residential proxy, a browser, and a challenge resolution cycle) and data requests are cheap. At 10x reuse, 90% of the clearance cost is spread across subsequent requests. At 100x reuse, the clearance cost becomes negligible.

One implementation detail that matters: HTTPX's `Client` object maintains a cookie jar across requests, while bare `httpx.get()` calls do not. Using the wrong interface causes cookies to be lost between requests, which breaks session continuity silently.

A related pattern is the `DisableCookieTransport` approach: a custom HTTPX transport that strips `Set-Cookie` headers from responses, preventing the server from overwriting the injected clearance cookies with new (unvalidated) ones during the data collection phase.

[PerimeterX](../entities/perimeterx.md) sessions require particular care on reset. Clearing cookies is not sufficient — a new browser context folder is required, because PerimeterX binds its validation to the browser profile, not just the cookie values.

## What We Tested

A consistent finding across multiple targets is that the same anti-bot system behaves differently site by site. [DataDome](../entities/datadome.md) is the clearest example: cookie reuse worked on Leboncoin, failed on Allegro, and worked with a different approach on Idealista — all three protected by the same vendor, none sharing the same session reuse behavior. The implication is that site operators configure anti-bot sensitivity independently, and no general rule about a vendor's cookie behavior applies universally.

## Current State

Cookie and session reuse is a fundamental technique with well-understood implementation requirements. The main failure modes are expired cookies, session binding that ties clearance to specific TLS sessions, and per-site configuration differences that make vendor-level assumptions unreliable.
