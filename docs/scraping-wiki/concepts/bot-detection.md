# Bot Detection

## Definition

Bot detection is the umbrella discipline of identifying automated traffic on a website and distinguishing it from legitimate human visitors. It sits opposite to web scraping: the same fingerprints, behaviors, and protocol-level traces that scrapers try to hide are what detection systems look for. Reading the detection literature is the most direct way for a scraper engineer to understand which signals actually leak.
 
## How It Works

Bot detection operates at multiple layers, often in combination:

**Network layer.** TLS handshake signatures (JA3, JA4), TCP/IP stack fingerprints, IP reputation against datacenter and known proxy ranges. Reveals automated clients before any HTTP traffic is sent.

**Protocol layer.** HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 frame ordering, header order and casing, missing or out-of-order Client Hints (`sec-ch-ua`, `sec-ch-ua-platform`, `sec-ch-ua-form-factors`). Curl, Python requests, and Go's net/http produce distinguishable patterns from real Chrome.

**Browser layer.** Headless markers (`navigator.webdriver`, missing `window.chrome`, plugins/permissions defaults), CDP channel detection (`Runtime.enable` side effects), automation extension presence, missing browser features that real Chrome ships with.

**Fingerprint layer.** Canvas rendering, WebGL parameters, audio context, font enumeration, screen and timezone consistency, GPU info from WebGPU. Anti-bot vendors maintain large databases of "human" fingerprint distributions and flag outliers.

**Behavioral layer.** Mouse movement profile, scroll patterns, click cadence, time-on-page distributions, navigation graph. Hard to fake convincingly without dedicated emulation libraries.

A practical dynamic runs through these layers. As scrapers learn to forge the upper, client-controlled signals (first the User-Agent, then the full ordered header set), detection sinks toward the layers a client cannot set from its request code. The current floor is the TLS handshake, fixed by the client's TLS library rather than anything in the request, which is why it is the signal that gives most HTTP clients away first (documented in Konstantin Lebedev's 2026 primer).

[ML-Based Bot Detection](ml-bot-detection.md) covers the model-driven side that combines all these layers into a risk score.

## Where It Matters

Every commercial anti-bot vendor TWSC tracks ([Cloudflare](../entities/cloudflare.md), [DataDome](../entities/datadome.md), [Akamai](../entities/akamai.md), [Kasada](../entities/kasada.md), [PerimeterX](../entities/perimeterx.md), [F5](../entities/f5-bot-defense.md), [AWS WAF](../entities/aws-waf.md)) implements some combination of these layers. The product differences are mostly about which layers they emphasize and how aggressive their scoring is.

Researchers like Antoine Vastel (DataDome) and the team behind Castle.io publish detection-side techniques openly. These articles are foundational reading for anyone building scrapers, because each technique they describe corresponds to a signal that needs to be neutralized on the scraper side.

## What We Tested

TWSC articles routinely benchmark anti-bot products to see which scraping configurations they catch and which they pass. Findings flow into individual entity pages ([DataDome](../entities/datadome.md), [Cloudflare](../entities/cloudflare.md), etc.) and concept pages on specific signals ([CDP Detection](cdp-detection.md), [Browser Fingerprinting](browser-fingerprinting.md), [TLS Fingerprinting](tls-fingerprinting.md), [Mouse Movement Emulation](mouse-movement-emulation.md)).

## Detect More Than They Block

A point worth separating from the signal layers: anti-bot systems can detect far more automation than they actually block. False positives hurt conversion, so vendors set blocking thresholds conservatively and leave many detection rules in "monitor only" mode. Browser Use's framing (February 2026) is that most automation works today not because it is undetectable but because the switch from monitor to block has not been flipped. JavaScript patches, stealth plugins, and CDP hacks are already detectable; they are simply tolerated. The expectation is that as AI agents flood the web and bot traffic crosses a tipping point, the cost of letting bots through will exceed the cost of occasionally blocking humans, and thresholds will tighten. A stealth stack that relies on lenient thresholds rather than genuine coherence is exposed to that shift.

A related scaling risk: anti-bot AI looks for shared fingerprint signatures across requests and applies temporal rules at the network level, not just per session. A fleet of scrapers sharing one fingerprint pattern (for example, Linux-everywhere with the same spoofed Windows profile) can be blocked wholesale when a single member is flagged. At scale, fingerprint diversity that matches real-world OS distribution (Windows ~60%, macOS ~35%, Linux ~5%) matters as much as per-session coherence. See [browser-fingerprinting](browser-fingerprinting.md) and [browser-use](../entities/browser-use.md).

## Current State

Bot detection has moved from rule-based filtering (User-Agent blocklists, IP reputation) to integrated multi-layer ML scoring across the last decade. The dominant pattern in 2026 is per-request risk score that combines passive signals (TLS, HTTP) with active challenges (Turnstile, Captcha, JS sensors) when risk is elevated. Stealth scrapers that pass at one anti-bot may fail at another because the layered weights differ.
