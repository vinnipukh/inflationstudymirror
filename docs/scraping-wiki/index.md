## Concepts

- [Agent Sandboxing](concepts/agent-sandboxing.md) — When an AI agent can execute arbitrary code (run Python, shell commands, write files), it can read anything on the machine it runs on: environment variables, API keys, database credentials, internal services. Agent sandboxing is the architecture that isolates that code execution from the infrastructure and secrets it must never reach. There are two structural patterns, documented by Browser Use in February 2026 from running millions of web agents.
- [AI Web API Fingerprinting](concepts/ai-web-api-fingerprinting.md) — Chrome's on-device AI Web APIs (Translator, Language Detector, Summarizer, and the upcoming LanguageModel) only function on hardware that meets specific minimum specifications. Querying whether these APIs are available, and measuring how fast they run, turns them into a hardware capability probe. The signal is harder to spoof than declarative properties like `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` because it reflects what the device can actually do, not what it claims. Documented by Anthony Manikhouth (DataDome R&D) in April 2026.
- [ai-scraping-assistants](concepts/ai-scraping-assistants.md) — AI scraping assistants are setups where a large language model is embedded into the development workflow to generate, modify, or repair scrapers — rather than to extract data at runtime. The LLM acts as an accelerator for the developer, not as a replacement for the scraper itself. The canonical current form is an AI-powered IDE (Cursor) connected to custom tooling via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- [Anti-Detect Browsers](concepts/anti-detect-browsers.md) — Anti-detect browsers are Chromium or Firefox forks engineered to present a consistent, plausible fingerprint from a database of real device profiles. Unlike standard browser automation which exposes the actual hardware and software environment of the machine running the scraper, anti-detect browsers attach a pre-built fingerprint from a real consumer device to the automation session, regardless of the actual underlying hardware.
- [API Scraping](concepts/api-scraping.md) — API scraping is the practice of identifying and replicating the internal HTTP requests that a browser or app makes to fetch data, bypassing HTML parsing entirely. The data is already structured, usually JSON, and the endpoint is observable by monitoring network traffic in DevTools or a proxy tool.
- [Bot Detection](concepts/bot-detection.md) — Bot detection is the umbrella discipline of identifying automated traffic on a website and distinguishing it from legitimate human visitors. It sits opposite to web scraping: the same fingerprints, behaviors, and protocol-level traces that scrapers try to hide are what detection systems look for. Reading the detection literature is the most direct way for a scraper engineer to understand which signals actually leak.
- [Browser Privacy Fingerprinting Defenses](concepts/browser-privacy-fingerprinting-defenses.md) — Apple, Mozilla, and Brave have shipped browser-level anti-fingerprinting protections that partition storage and add noise to or remove the very APIs that bot detection vendors relied on for high-entropy device identification. The consequence for both tracking and bot detection is that classic client-side fingerprinting is becoming low-entropy: previously distinctive signals now return generic or randomized values across users. Documented by Anthony Manikhouth (DataDome R&D) in December 2025.
- [browser-fingerprinting](concepts/browser-fingerprinting.md) — A stateless, cookieless tracking mechanism that identifies browsers by collecting and hashing the outputs of browser APIs. Unlike cookies, fingerprints require no storage on the client and persist across sessions, incognito modes, and cookie clears.
- [canvas-fingerprinting](concepts/canvas-fingerprinting.md) — Canvas fingerprinting is a stateless tracking technique that identifies a device by drawing graphics off-screen and hashing the resulting pixels. Two machines asked to render the same text and shapes produce subtly different pixel output, because the final image depends on the GPU, the graphics driver, the font rasterizer, and the anti-aliasing settings of that specific machine. The hash of those pixels becomes a high-entropy identifier that needs no cookie and survives incognito mode and cache clears.
- [cdp-detection](concepts/cdp-detection.md) — A detection technique that identifies browser automation by observing the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) commands sent to the browser during page load. CDP is the underlying control protocol used by Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium (on Chromium), and related frameworks. Anti-bot systems can detect its presence independently of any JavaScript-level signals.
- [Certificate Pinning](concepts/certificate-pinning.md) — Certificate pinning is a security mechanism in mobile apps that causes the app to reject any TLS certificate that does not match a specific expected certificate or public key, regardless of whether the device's OS trusts the certificate authority. It prevents man-in-the-middle inspection even on a device where the inspector's root CA has been installed.
- [cookie-session-reuse](concepts/cookie-session-reuse.md) — A technique where anti-bot clearance cookies obtained through one browser session are extracted and reused across multiple subsequent requests made by a browserless HTTP client. The browser absorbs the cost of the challenge once; the HTTP client amortizes that cost across many requests.
- [homepage-first-navigation](concepts/homepage-first-navigation.md) — A navigation pattern where a scraper visits the site's homepage (or another entry-point URL) before accessing any deep content pages. The purpose is to establish session state — cookies, fingerprint checks, and anti-bot challenges — in the same sequence a real user would encounter them.
- [HTTP Performance in Scraping](concepts/http-performance.md) — HTTP performance optimization for scraping covers the set of techniques that reduce execution time, bandwidth cost, and infrastructure requirements without changing the data extracted. The main levers are concurrency, protocol selection, caching, and retry behavior.
- [hybrid-scraping](concepts/hybrid-scraping.md) — An architecture that uses a full browser only for the portions of a session that require anti-bot clearance, then hands off to a lightweight HTTP client for all subsequent data requests. The browser handles authentication and challenge resolution; the HTTP client handles scale.
- [inventory-tracking](concepts/inventory-tracking.md) — Inventory tracking through web scraping is the practice of monitoring the stock levels of products on e-commerce sites and retail websites by extracting data that those sites expose for operational purposes — usually to power their own availability and pickup features. The extracted data is most valuable as a repeated time series rather than a single snapshot.
- [llm-scraping](concepts/llm-scraping.md) — Using a large language model to extract structured data from web pages, replacing or supplementing traditional CSS selector or XPath-based parsing. The LLM interprets the page content — either raw HTML, cleaned text, or a screenshot — and returns structured output matching a defined schema. A separate but related use case is using LLMs to generate scraper code rather than to parse data at runtime.
- [location-data-scraping](concepts/location-data-scraping.md) — Location data scraping covers the techniques for extracting data that is spatially indexed — store locators, accommodation listings, restaurant maps, delivery zones — where the API requires geographic inputs (coordinates, radius, or bounding box) and returns data for the area specified. The central challenge is ensuring complete geographic coverage without issuing redundant or missing queries.
- [ML-Based Bot Detection](concepts/ml-bot-detection.md) — ML-based bot detection refers to the use of machine learning models to classify web traffic as human or automated. Unlike rule-based systems (IP blocklists, simple rate limits, user-agent checks), ML models learn from behavioral patterns across large traffic datasets and can identify subtle automation signals that static rules miss.
- [Mobile App Scraping](concepts/mobile-app-scraping.md) — Mobile app scraping is the practice of intercepting the network traffic generated by a mobile app and replicating the underlying API calls in a scraper. Since mobile apps communicate with backends through the same HTTP/HTTPS protocol as browsers, the data they fetch can be captured and reproduced.
- [Mobile Proxy Farming](concepts/mobile-proxy-farming.md) — Mobile proxy farming is the practice of building and operating infrastructure that routes proxy traffic through real cellular network connections — typically USB modems or SIM-equipped hardware — to produce genuine mobile IP addresses with CGNAT-level trust properties. Unlike SDK-sourced residential proxies, which borrow device connections from consumer apps, a proxy farm gives the operator full control over the hardware, IP rotation, and connectivity.
- [Mouse Movement Emulation](concepts/mouse-movement-emulation.md) — Mouse movement emulation is the practice of generating pointer trajectories that match the statistical properties of human hand movement during browser automation. Anti-bot systems that monitor mouse events can distinguish between the instantaneous or straight-line movements produced by automation frameworks and the curved, velocity-varied paths that humans produce. Emulation attempts to make automated mouse behavior indistinguishable from real user input at the event listener level.
- [Prerender Stealth Request](concepts/prerender-stealth-request.md) — A `<link rel="prerender">` element in Chromium-based browsers fires a real HTTP request that bypasses Content Security Policy, does not appear in the DevTools Network tab, and sends the browser's real User-Agent even when DevTools' Network Conditions UA override is active. Discovered by Manuel Garcia (brokenbrowser.com) in May 2026, independently confirmed by soutag (who found it earlier but did not publish).
- [proxy-fundamentals](concepts/proxy-fundamentals.md) — Proxies route outbound HTTP requests through an intermediate IP address, changing the apparent origin of the request. In a scraping context, the proxy's IP reputation, ASN, and network type are often more consequential than any browser-level signal.
- [Scraping Infrastructure](concepts/scraping-infrastructure.md) — Scraping infrastructure encompasses the compute, storage, scheduling, monitoring, and proxy management systems that run scrapers reliably at scale. The choice of infrastructure directly determines cost structure, IP rotation capability, and operational overhead. A scraper that works on a laptop fails at 100,000 requests per day without the right infrastructure beneath it.
- [scraping-economics](concepts/scraping-economics.md) — The economics of web scraping encompass the cost structure of running scraping operations, the business models for monetizing scraped data, and the market dynamics of the web data industry. The industry spans two distinct roles: those who sell the infrastructure and tools that enable scraping ("selling shovels"), and those who scrape and sell the resulting data.
- [Static ISP Proxies](concepts/static-isp-proxies.md) — Static ISP proxies are a hybrid category between datacenter and residential proxies. The IP addresses belong to real ISP allocations (Comcast, RCN, AT&T, Verizon) or to fabricated ISPs with fictional names. In both cases the server handling traffic is physically in a datacenter. The distinguishing characteristic is that the address block carries ISP reputation rather than datacenter ASN reputation, and the IP stays assigned to a single customer for weeks or months rather than rotating.
- [tls-fingerprinting](concepts/tls-fingerprinting.md) — A detection technique that identifies the client making an HTTPS request by analyzing the structure of its TLS ClientHello message, before any application-layer data is exchanged. The most common implementation is JA3, which produces an MD5 hash from five fields in the handshake: TLS version, cipher suite IDs, extension IDs, elliptic curve IDs, and elliptic curve format IDs. JA4 is the more recent successor scheme, more granular and harder to evade, but built on the same principle of hashing handshake fields the client never chooses from code.
- [Web Unblockers](concepts/web-unblockers.md) — A web unblocker is a managed API that accepts a target URL and returns the page content after transparently handling IP rotation, CAPTCHA solving, browser fingerprinting, and anti-bot bypass on the provider's infrastructure. The caller makes a standard HTTP request; the provider does the work of getting through the target's defenses.
- [web-scraping-legal-landscape](concepts/web-scraping-legal-landscape.md) — The legal landscape for web scraping is a contested, evolving body of case law and regulation across multiple jurisdictions. No single statute governs it. Whether any particular scraping operation is legal depends on the interaction of: the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), copyright law, contract law (Terms of Service), and in Europe, the GDPR. The area has shifted materially between 2022 and 2026, with courts increasingly being asked to define where public data access ends and illegal circumvention begins.
- [WebDriver vs CDP vs WebDriver BiDi](concepts/webdriver-vs-cdp-vs-bidi.md) — Three distinct protocols exist for controlling a browser programmatically. They differ in design origin, transport mechanism, browser support, and what detection surface they expose. Choosing the wrong one for a scraping context can introduce detection vectors that are independent of any fingerprint or behavior emulation.
- [webrtc-ip-leak](concepts/webrtc-ip-leak.md) — A WebRTC IP leak is when a page learns a client's real LAN or WAN IP address through the WebRTC API, even though the client's HTTP traffic is routed through a proxy. It happens because WebRTC gathers network candidates over UDP, on a path that an ordinary HTTP proxy does not control. For a scraper this is a coherence failure: the site sees one IP for the page requests (the proxy) and a different IP for WebRTC (the real machine), and the mismatch is a strong automation and evasion signal.
- [WebSocket Bot Detection](concepts/websocket-bot-detection.md) — WebSocket bot detection refers to anti-bot techniques that exploit the stateful, persistent nature of the WebSocket protocol to identify automated clients. Because WebSocket connections are long-lived and bidirectional, servers can monitor client behavior continuously over the connection lifetime, enabling detection patterns that are not possible with stateless HTTP.
- [websocket-scraping](concepts/websocket-scraping.md) — WebSocket scraping is the practice of connecting to a site's WebSocket endpoint directly, subscribing to the same channels the browser subscribes to, and receiving the same real-time data stream. Unlike HTTP scraping, which is request-response, WebSocket connections are persistent and bidirectional. The server pushes updates without the client polling.

## Comparisons

- [Anti-Detect Browser Benchmark 2024](comparisons/anti-detect-browser-benchmark-2024.md) — Eight commercial anti-detect browsers evaluated against a standardized fingerprint detection test suite. The comparison measures how convincingly each browser impersonates a real consumer device when probed by the same fingerprinting methods that anti-bot systems use.
- [Camoufox vs its forks](comparisons/camoufox-vs-forks.md) — After development of [Camoufox](../entities/camoufox.md) moved to CloverLabs in 2026, its public repository grew past 750 forks. Most are mirror bots with no commits of their own. This page compares stock Camoufox against the three forks that actually change anti-detect behavior, and records which one to run against a real target. The comparison is grounded in our 2026-06 testing against [Datadome](../entities/datadome.md) on leboncoin.fr, not on the forks' stated goals.
- [Firefox-based vs Chrome-based Stealth Tools](comparisons/firefox-vs-chrome-stealth.md) — Firefox-based stealth tools (primarily [Camoufox](../entities/camoufox.md)) against Chrome-based stealth tools ([Pydoll](../entities/pydoll.md), [undetected-chromedriver](../entities/undetected-chromedriver.md), [Patchright](../entities/playwright.md)) for bypassing anti-bot systems. This comparison matters because the browser engine choice has a measurable impact on bypass success rates, independently of the stealth techniques applied on top.
