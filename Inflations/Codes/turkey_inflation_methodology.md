# Turkey-Wide Inflation Calculator — Methodology

**Script:** `turkey_inflation.py`  
**Data root:** `InflationItems/Datas/`  
**Output:** `Inflations/Datas/Final_Reports/`  
**Base:** TÜİK COICOP 2018, basket year 2025=100

---

## Overview

`turkey_inflation.py` aggregates daily scraped price data from 100+ Turkish retail stores across 9 sectors and computes the following inflation metrics:

| Metric                       | Description                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic Inflation**          | Basket-level price index change: `(Σ current prices / Σ past prices − 1) × 100`                         |
| **Average Inflation**        | Arithmetic mean of per-product percentage changes                                                       |
| **Median Inflation**         | Median of per-product percentage changes (typically 0%, see below)                                      |
| **Median Inflation (Nonzero)** | Median percentage change among only the products whose price actually changed                        |
| **% Increased / Decreased / Unchanged** | Share of matched products whose price went up, down, or stayed the same                    |
| **TÜİK Weighted (Products)** | Category-level weighted average using TÜİK COICOP 2026 basket weights, normalised to covered categories |
| **TÜİK Weighted (Full)**     | Same as above but includes rent (group 04) injected from housing data                                   |

> **Note on Median Inflation:** In practice, `median_inflation` is **0.0% in nearly every period**, because 76–87% of tracked SKUs show no price change between monthly snapshots — most stores do not reprice every item every month. This is a structural property of the data, not a bug. `median_inflation_nonzero` and the `pct_increased`/`pct_decreased`/`pct_unchanged` breakdown are reported alongside it to give a meaningful picture of repricing behaviour: the median magnitude of change *when a change occurs*, and how common changes actually are.

Metrics are computed for **15-day** and **30-day** intervals by default. A custom comparison date can be passed via `--compare`, in which case all interval-suffixed columns use the generic `compare` label and the comparison date is recorded separately in the `compare_date` column.

Group 09 is now covered through EpeyKatfg and technology sources. Group 07 has only a tentative Epey tyres mapping and is excluded from default weighting unless its minimum-group sample gate passes. Groups 02, 10 and 12 remain uncovered.

When TÜİK Weighted metrics are computed, weights are **re-normalised** to sum to 100% across only the groups present in the data for that run.

### Group 04 — Housing / Rent (`HousesRent/`) — Special Handling

Rent data is **not** processed through the standard product pipeline. Instead:

1. For each run date, the mean rent listing price is computed per city/district from all scraped files matching that date.
2. The same is done for the comparison date.
3. Rent inflation is computed as the **Carli index across cities**: arithmetic mean of `(mean_rent_city_t / mean_rent_city_0 − 1) × 100` over all cities present in both snapshots. Each city receives equal weight regardless of population or market size. If fewer than **3** cities are common to both dates, a warning is logged noting the result may not be representative, but the figure is still computed.
4. This single figure is injected into the **TÜİK Weighted (Full)** metric as group 04. Weights are re-normalised to include group 04 alongside the tracked product categories.
5. Rent does **not** appear in Basic Inflation, Average Inflation, or TÜİK Weighted (Products), which are product-level metrics only.

## Deduplication

Deduplication runs in three stages, all keyed on the normalised product name (Turkish diacritics stripped, lowercased, whitespace collapsed):

**Stage 1 — within store:** Duplicate rows for the same product in one store's CSV are collapsed to a single row by averaging prices.

**Stage 2 — cross-store:** After matching current and past snapshots, products appearing in multiple stores within the same sector are averaged across stores (equal store weight). This produces one price and one relative per `(canonical_key, tuik_category, sector)` triplet.

**Stage 3 — cross-sector:** Some sectors share a TUIK category (HomeGoods and ConstructionSupplies both map to group 05). After stage 2, rows are further collapsed across sectors within the same `(canonical_key, tuik_category)` pair, again by simple averaging. This prevents the same physical product from being counted twice in the basket sum or the weighted index.

---

## Outlier Filter

Price changes with `|relative change| > 80%` within a single comparison interval are excluded before metric computation. This filters out scraping errors (e.g. prices recorded at 10× scale on a given date) without affecting genuine large but plausible price movements. Both the relative and the underlying current/past prices are nullified for excluded rows, so outlier products do not bias the Dutot (basket-sum) index either. Excluded pair counts are logged per run.

The threshold is defined as `_OUTLIER_THRESHOLD = 80.0` at module level for reproducibility. Sensitivity analyses can be run by adjusting this constant (±20 pp).

| `relative_{label}` | Cross-sector-averaged % price change vs the comparison date. `{label}` is `15d`/`30d` in default mode, or `compare` when run with `--compare`. NaN if the product had no match on the comparison date. |

### `turkey_inflation_summary.csv`

Time series, sorted by `date`. One row per `(date, compare_date)` pair. When a row with the same `(date, compare_date)` is re-computed, it replaces the existing row; runs with the same target date but a different comparison date produce separate rows.

Interval-suffixed columns use `{label}` = `15d`/`30d` in default mode, or `compare` when run with `--compare` (with the actual comparison date recorded in `compare_date`).

## Known Limitations

| Limitation                                                     | Impact                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Groups 02, 10 and 12 not covered; group 07 is only tentatively represented by tyres | Standard basket coverage is ~77.5% (`basket_coverage_full_pct`); TÜİK weighted metric re-normalises to covered groups. `basket_coverage_pct` reports product-only coverage (excludes group 04 rent); `basket_coverage_full_pct` includes group 04 when city-level rent data is present |
| EnglishHome excluded (flash-sale volatility)                   | HomeGoods sector coverage reduced                                              |
| Rent covers listing prices only, not actual transaction prices | Group 04 is an approximation                                                   |
| Health data is monthly, not daily                              | Group 06 may lag by up to 30 days                                              |
| Scraper availability varies by day                             | Low-data days (fewer stores) produce less reliable estimates                   |
| Restaurant data currently limited to Istanbul venues           | Group 11 has geographic bias                                                   |
| Most SKUs are unchanged month-to-month                         | `median_inflation` is ~0% in nearly every period; use `median_inflation_nonzero` and `pct_increased`/`pct_decreased`/`pct_unchanged` instead for distributional insight |
| `InflationItems/Datas/PublicTransportation/` exists but is not fully wired into `_SECTOR_CONFIG`; Epey tyres are the only tentative group-07 mapping | Group 07 remains excluded from default weighting until coverage and sample gates are satisfied |
